CRUD on User

CRUD on Music

Liking features on songs(user and admin can both like songs)
Lyrics feature on songs(user and admn can both view the lyrics of songs)
Playlits feature on songs(user and admn can both create playlist of multiple songs)

User
Creates account
Logs in
Listens to Music
Likes Music
Reads Lyrics
Creates Playlists
Edit account information
View Others Account
Account contains information like fav song, fav lyric, fav playlist

Admin
Creates account
Logs in
Listens to Music
Likes Music
Reads Lyrics
Creates Playlists
Edit account information
View Others Account
Account contains information like fav song, fav lyric, fav playlist
Can promote Users to Admins

Music
Is uploaedd by either Admin or User
Has properties like name, track duration, track description etc
can be updated by admin or users who have uploaded music

Some sort of music recomendation system
Music recomendation done by ucb1 and epsilon greedy algorithm

ok. So basically i will need to change both the music fetching endpoint so that only recommended songs are sent and the upload process also needs to be expanded upon by getting song metadata and storing in the database.

ignore feature
public/private/only me
song can chage privicy level
like music shuffel-most payed must come on top







Hello Manus AI,

I'm working on a Spotify clone project, which you can find here: https://github.com/Hellsrest/Spotify-clone. I want to enhance the music recommendation system by integrating two reinforcement learning algorithms: UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound 1) and Epsilon-Greedy.

Project Overview:
Frontend: Built with React and TypeScript.
Backend: Node.js with Express, connected to a MongoDB database.

Current Features: User authentication, playlist creation, music streaming, and liking songs.

Objective:
Implement the UCB1 and Epsilon-Greedy algorithms in Python to improve personalized music recommendations based on user interactions, such as song likes and play counts.

Requirements:
Algorithm Implementation:
Provide Python implementations of the UCB1 and Epsilon-Greedy algorithms.
Ensure the code is modular and well-documented for integration purposes.

Data Handling:
Design the algorithms to process user interaction data, such as:
Song play counts.
Likes/dislikes.
Skipped songs.

The data will be fetched from the existing MongoDB database.

Integration Strategy:
Outline how the Python modules can interface with the current Node.js backend.
Suggest methods for data exchange between the backend and the Python recommendation system (e.g., REST API endpoints, message queues).

Recommendation Output:
The algorithms should output a ranked list of song recommendations for each user.
Include confidence scores or probabilities associated with each recommendation.

Scalability and Performance:
Ensure the solution is scalable to handle a growing number of users and songs.
Optimize for performance to provide real-time or near-real-time recommendations.


Documentation:
Offer comprehensive documentation covering:
Setup and installation instructions.

Usage examples.
Integration guidelines with the existing project.

Additional Notes:
Feel free to use existing libraries or frameworks that facilitate reinforcement learning and recommendation systems.
If possible, provide visualizations to illustrate how the algorithms make decisions based on user data.
Your expertise in implementing these algorithms will significantly enhance the personalization aspect of the Spotify clone, leading to a more engaging user experience.

Thank you!
