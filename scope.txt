Music
Is uploaedd by either Admin or User
Has properties like name, track duration, track description etc
can be updated by admin or users who have uploaded music

Some sort of music recomendation system
Music recomendation done by ucb1 and epsilon greedy algorithm

ok. So basically i will need to change both the music fetching endpoint so that only recommended songs are sent and the upload process also needs to be expanded upon by getting song metadata and storing in the database.
